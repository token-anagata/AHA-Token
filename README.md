# AHA-Token

Boilerplate code for creating Solidity tokens.

```
git clone https://github.com/merchantry/AHA-Token.git
cd AHA-Token
npm install
npm run test
```

Add the contracts you want to compile to `contracts.js`

Use helper `useMethodsOn` to asynchronously and consecutively call methods on a compiled contract
